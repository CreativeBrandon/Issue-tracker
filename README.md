# Issue Tracker App - React Redux Typescript

Simple app designed to document my learnings by getting hands on with React Redux with Typescript.  

This project was bootstrapped with a fork of [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) called [Create React App Typescript](https://github.com/wmonk/create-react-app-typescript).

## Concepts Covered
* Routing with React Router 4
* Smart & dumb components
* HOC passing data to components
* Redux
* Redux forms
* Normalized State data
* CSS Modules via [custom react scripts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-scripts-ts-css-modules)
* Jest + Enzyme tests

## ToDo:
* Style Redux form
* Style pages & components
* Route authenticaion for DashboardPage
* ...

## Build App 
For the project to build, **these files must exist with exact filenames**:

* `public/index.html` is the page template;
* `src/index.js` is the JavaScript entry point.

You can delete or rename the other files.

You may create subdirectories inside `src`. For faster rebuilds, only files inside `src` are processed by Webpack.<br>
You need to **put any JS and CSS files inside `src`**, otherwise Webpack wonâ€™t see them.

Only files inside `public` can be used from `public/index.html`.<br>
Read instructions below for using assets from JavaScript and HTML.

## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](#running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
